# Nlab Creative Theme

Nlab Creative Theme is a fork of Creative Theme for Nakayama Lab's webpage. The original theme is a one page portfolio for creatives based on the [original Bootstrap theme](//github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-creative) by [David Miller](//github.com/davidtmiller). Noteworthy features of this Hugo theme are several content sections and a responsive portfolio grid with hover effects and full page portfolio item modals.
